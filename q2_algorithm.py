def isProjective(heads: T.Iterable[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether the dependency tree for a sentence is projective.

    Args:
        heads: The indices of the heads of the words in sentence. Since ROOT
          has no head, it is not expected to be part of the input, but the
          index values in heads are such that ROOT is assumed in the
          starting (zeroth) position. See the examples below.

    Returns:
        True if and only if the tree represented by the input is
          projective.

    Examples:
        The projective tree from the assignment handout:
        >>> isProjective([2, 5, 4, 2, 0, 7, 5, 7])
        True

        The non-projective tree from the assignment handout:
        >>> isProjective([2, 0, 2, 2, 6, 3, 6])
        False

def isSingleRoot(heads: Tensor, lengths: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """
    Determines whether the selected arcs for a sentence constitute a tree with
    a single root word.

    Remember that index 0 indicates the ROOT node. A tree with "a single root
    word" has exactly one outgoing edge from ROOT.

    If you like, you may add helper functions to this file for this function.

    This file already imports the function `pad` for you. You may find that
    function handy. Here's the documentation of the function:
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.pad.html

    Args:
        heads (Tensor): a Tensor of dimensions (batch_sz, sent_len) and dtype
            int where the entry at index (b, i) indicates the index of the
            predicted head for vertex i for input b in the batch

        lengths (Tensor): a Tensor of dimensions (batch_sz,) and dtype int
            where each element indicates the number of words (this doesn't
            include ROOT) in the corresponding sentence.

    Returns:
        A Tensor of dtype bool and dimensions (batch_sz,) where the value
        for each element is True if and only if the corresponding arcs
        constitute a single-root-word tree as defined above

    Examples:
        Valid trees from the assignment handout:
        >>> isSingleRoot(torch.tensor([[2, 5, 4, 2, 0, 7, 5, 7],\
                                              [2, 0, 2, 2, 6, 3, 6, 0]]),\
                                torch.tensor([8, 7]))
        tensor([True, True])

        Invalid trees (the first has a cycle; the second has multiple roots):
        >>> isSingleRoot(torch.tensor([[2, 5, 4, 2, 0, 8, 6, 7],\
                                              [2, 0, 2, 2, 6, 3, 6, 0]]),\

def mstSingleRoot(arcTensor: Tensor, lengths: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """
    Finds the maximum spanning tree (more technically, arborescence) for the
    given sentences such that each tree has a single root word.

    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.pad.html

    Args:
        arcTensor (Tensor): a Tensor of dimensions (batch_sz, x, y) and dtype
            float where x=y and the entry at index (b, i, j) indicates the
            score for a candidate arc from vertex j to vertex i.

        lengths (Tensor): a Tensor of dimensions (batch_sz,) and dtype int
            where each element indicates the number of words (this doesn't
            include ROOT) in the corresponding sentence.

    Returns:
        A Tensor of dtype int and dimensions (batch_sz, x) where the value at
        index (b, i) indicates the head for vertex i according to the
        maximum spanning tree for the input graph.
